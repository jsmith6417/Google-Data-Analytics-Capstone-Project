### Cyclistic 12 Month Analysis ###
### July 2022 through June 2023 ###

# This analysis is based on the Divvy case study "'Sophisticated, Clear, and Polishedâ€™: Divvy and Data Visualization" written by Kevin Hartman (found here: https://artscience.blog/home/divvy-dataviz-case-study).

#========================================================
# Step 0: Install the packages we need and load libraries
#========================================================
# tidyverse for data import and cleanup
# lubridate for date and time functions
# ggplot for visualizations
# dplyr for data manipulation

install.packages("tidyverse")

setwd("D:/OneDrive/Documents/Capstone/CSV") #Set working directory to location of CSV data files on your machine
getwd() #Make sure that working directory is set correctly

#===============================
# STEP 1: Upload Data to RStudio
#===============================
# Upload datasets for the most recent 12 months of data (csv files)

# STEP 2: Examine Data and Combine Into a Single File
#====================================================
# Make sure the column names are the same in every file
# Column names should be identical in all files (so that we can join them into one file)
# Column names do not need to be in the same order in every file
